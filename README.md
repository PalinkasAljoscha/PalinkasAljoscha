# Quantum Random Walks
Jupyter notebook and untils to animate quantum random walks on circle or hypercube.
Following some things discussed and examplified in:
Kempe, J. “Quantum Random Walks: An Introductory Overview.” Contemporary Physics 44.4 (2003): 307–327. Crossref. Web. arXiv:quant-ph/0303081
also recreating and vizualising the search algorithm in
Shenvi, Neil, Julia Kempe, and K. Birgitta Whaley. "Quantum random-walk search algorithm." Physical Review A 67.5 (2003): 052307.

all calculations are done in plain numpy (as en exercise to get used to quantum calculations, of course it would be easier and more elegant to use e.g. cirq)
